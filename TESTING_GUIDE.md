# 🧪 SOLIDWORKS Upload System - Quick Testing Guide

## আগে GitHub Token তৈরি করুন

### Step 1: Create GitHub Personal Access Token

1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new
2. **Token name:** A3KM Studio Upload Manager
3. **Expiration:** 90 days (or No expiration)
4. **Select scopes:**
   - ✅ **repo** (Full control of private repositories)
     - ✅ repo:status
     - ✅ repo_deployment
     - ✅ public_repo
     - ✅ repo:invite
     - ✅ security_events
5. Click **Generate token**
6. **IMPORTANT:** Copy token immediately (starts with `ghp_`)
7. Save somewhere safe (can't see again!)

---

## 🎯 Test 1: Setup Token (প্রথমবার)

### Steps:
1. Open: `only-boss-dashboard.html` in browser
2. Click **SOLIDWORKS Upload Manager** card
3. See token input screen
4. Paste your `ghp_xxxxx...` token
5. ☑ Check "Remember token" (optional - keeps token after browser close)
6. Click **Validate** button

### Expected Result:
```
✅ Token configured • your-github-username
Change Token
```

### If Error:
- ❌ "Invalid token" → Check token copied correctly
- ❌ "Token expired" → Create new token
- ❌ "No repo access" → Make sure 'repo' scope selected

---

## 🎯 Test 2: Check Category Counts

### Steps:
1. Panel should show category counts:
   ```
   🔧 Basic - 35 models • Next: Model 36
   ⚙️ Intermediate - 0 models • Next: Model 01
   ⭐ Pro - 0 models • Next: Model 01
   💎 Paid - 0 models • Next: Model 01
   ```

### What This Means:
- System successfully scanned GitHub folders
- Detected Model 01-35 in Basic
- Other categories empty (will start at Model 01)

### If Error:
- ❌ "Loading..." forever → Check internet connection
- ❌ "Error loading" → Token might not have repo access

## 🎯 Test 3: Upload Files (Basic Category)

### Prepare Test Files:
Create 3 test files:
1. `test-model.glb` (any GLB file, or rename any file)
2. `test-drawing.pdf` (any PDF)
3. `test-image.png` (any image)

### Steps:
1. Click **Basic** category button (should turn red/highlighted)
2. See: "Next model will be created as: **Model 36**"
3. Click **"Click to browse files"** area
4. Select all 3 test files
5. See file preview list:
   ```
   Selected Files (3)
   📄 test-model.glb - 2.5 MB   ⏳
   📄 test-drawing.pdf - 1.2 MB ⏳
   📄 test-image.png - 450 KB   ⏳
   ```
6. Click **Upload Files** button

### Expected Progress:
```
[Progress Bar] 0% → 10% → 45% → 80% → 100%
